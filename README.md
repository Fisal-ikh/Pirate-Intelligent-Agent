# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent
1. Work Done on the Project:
I worked on developing a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning. I was given some base code for environment setup and agent movement, and I created the Q-learning algorithm to train the agent, along with functions for training and tracking performance.

2. Connection to Computer Science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems and develop algorithms that power innovations like AI and automation, which are crucial in modern technology.
How do I approach problems as a computer scientist?
I break down problems, research solutions, and iteratively build and test code. For this project, I applied reinforcement learning principles to train the agent effectively.
What are my ethical responsibilities?
I must ensure the solutions are unbiased, transparent, and beneficial to the end user, aligning with both organizational and user needs.
